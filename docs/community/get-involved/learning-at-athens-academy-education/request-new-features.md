# Request new features

The Athens community uses [GitHub's discussions](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/discussions) feature to propose, organize around, and track progress around feature requests.

### Create a new feature request

The first step is to search existing discussions to see if your feature has been requested by another member of the Athens community. If it's already there, feel free to add additional context to the existing issue or simply give it an emoji reaction to let the community know that you think it's important.

Click here to [create a new feature request](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/discussions/new?category=feature-requests).

Enter a descriptive title, then describe the feature you're looking for in the text area, keeping the below tips in mind.

### Tips for good feature requests

* Make sure you've searched the Athens repository existing feature requests! 
* Try to answer the following question: **What value does this feature provide to users?**
* Describe **who** will use this feature, as it might not be relevant to everyone.
* Describe the "expected" behavior. What is the user experience around this feature?
* If relevant, include screenshots, videos, or links to similar features in other applications that can help illustrate the feature you're requesting.

### How feature requests become actively developed

Requests are turned into issues on three occasions:

1. A member of the Athens development community starts working on the requested feature.
2. The [Athens core team](../../../company/org-chart/core-team/) puts the feature on the [roadmap](../../../about-us/roadmap.md).
3. The Athens core team creates a Gitcoin bounty for the issue and lets another member of the community volunteer themselves.

Not every feature request can be worked on right away, either due to lack of resources or because the request isn't defined well enough. In either case, we leave the thread open for further discussion and alignment on how to best implement the requested feature.
