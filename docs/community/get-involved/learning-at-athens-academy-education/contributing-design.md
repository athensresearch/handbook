  Good user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) are critical to the Athens
  experience. We're always looking for ways to streamline workflows and make
  features just make sense.

# Improve design

We design Athens in the open and in collaboration with the technical stakeholders to ensure we're delivering intuitive, powerful features. The work itself happens in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

The best kinds of design contributions fit under one of two categories:

* A wireframe to suggest the UX for a proposed new feature, such as [import/export](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/discussions/874).
* A completed, polished UI that would improve the UX for an existing feature.

Here's how to get started.

* Get a [Figma account](https://www.figma.com/) if you don't have one already, and familiarize yourself with how it works.
* Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V) and see what's happening in the `#design` channel, or DM **shanberg** directly, to learn about the people and processes in Athens design.
* Look at the [`#design` tag on GitHub](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adesign) issues to find the latest tasks.
* Check out the [Athens Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/XITWUHZHNJsIbcCsBkOHpZ/Athens-Design-System?node-id=26%3A446) on Figma to see the building blocks for creating UIs and workflows. This design system isn't currently actively maintained right now, so it's not the only source of truth for Athens design concepts.
* See design and branding concepts in the [Athens Design Sandbox](https://www.figma.com/file/zpnDCLykhdQyq5FANJb3Vz/Athens-Design-Sandbox?node-id=0%3A1). 
* Get started designing in your own Figma pages! 
* When you have something to share, paste the link in the `#design` channel on[ Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V) to start the conversation.
