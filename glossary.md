# Glossary

The following are current terms used at Athens Research. 

### Agile \#OS

A type of methodology used to create iterative, incremental software. 

### Athens Database \#UA

All of the content in your current Athens instance. 

### Backlog \#OS

A list of ever-evolving to-do items that still need to be done, typically created for each iteration. 

### Bi-Directional Link \#UA 

A link that is valid in two directions. It contains a link to the pages or nodes that point to it and makes them visible.

### Block \#UA

A container used to insert information such as a paragraph of text that is processed as a single unit in a database. 

### Block Embed \#UA

A signifier indicating an insertion point of information contained within a block that will show a copy of the block and can be edited. 

### Block Reference \#UA

A signifier indicating an insertion point of information contained within a block that will show a copy of the block but cannot be edited.

### Bug \#OS

An obvious error that is typically a defect in the code. Changes required to accommodate unsupported third-party software are not considered bugs. 

### Clojure \#CO

A dynamic and functional dialect of the Lisp programming language on a Java platform, which focuses on creating programs that are robust, simple, and fast. 

### Clojurefam \#CO

### Customer \#OS

Product owner that may or may not also be a user. 

### DevOps \#OS

A set of quality practices used to reduce time between committing changes.

### Edge \#UA

One of the connections between nodes in a network. 

### Epic \#CO \#OS

A series of user stories that share a strategic objective. Projects labeled epic in Github typically require development that will last for several sprints or over many months. 

### Github \#CO \#OS

Github helps developers manage software projects by allowing many contributors to work together at the same time by participating in discussions, submitting issues like bug reports, making [pull requests](https://github.com/athensresearch/handbook/pulls), and committing changes. 

### Graph \#UA

An visualization of the blocks in your database and how they are connected to each other. 

### Handbook-first \#CO

### Impediment \#OS

Something that stands in your way while getting something done. Impediments also known as blocks are commonly discussed in daily Scrum stand ups.

### Iteration \#OS

A new version of a piece of software. Iterations allow improvements to quickly be made and offered each time minimally viable changes have been made. Iterative development is a project life-cycle strategy. 

### Knowledge Base \#?

A technology used to store structured and unstructured information. A knowledge base has distinct needs from database requirements and does not require structure data.

### Knowledge Graph \#?

A knowledge base that presents integrated data in a graph structure. Knowledge graphs typically store interlinked descriptions of entities with free-form semantics.

### Learn-in-Public \#CO

Sharing what you are working on with other people and being transparent about your personal growth with a public audience. Athens contributors are encouraged to share what they are working on in Discord through daily check-ins and sharing your screen as you work and learn. Learning in public supports greater accountability and is a shared value by many developers and open-source communities.

### LHS \#UA

Left-Hand Sidebar

### Linked References \#UA

An overview that shows blocks that link to the current page.

### Local-First \#UA/\#OS

A descriptor of software principles that support individual users owning their data while still being able to collaborate in the cloud with others. Local-first software is designed so users can work offline across multiple devices, while still being private and secure. 

### Memex \#?

A conceptual data storage and retrieval system designed by Vannevar Bush intended to enhance record access. 

### Metadata \#UA

Data that describes and gives contextual information about data such as information about the blocks on a page.

### Nesting \#UA

Content in the form of a block that is located underneath another block. The block that appears lower in the hierarchy is called a child block. Outliner apps like Athens use nested blocks that are collapsible. 

### Node \#UA

A node is a data point or a device that connects to a larger network. 

### Open Source \#OS

referring to a movement or community that opens access to software source code for possible modification and redistribution

### Outliner \#UA

### Page \#UA

A collection of blocks. The name of the page is the top block.

### Page reference \#UA

### Persona \(User Persona\) \#OS

A fictional representative user with needs, goals, and habits detailed. Used by developers to determine whether or not the product meets the users' needs.

### Queries \#UA

A search for blocks that can use Boolean logic. 

### Retrospective \#OS

A meeting held to examine processes used and determine what succeeded and what can be improved. 

### Scrum \#OS

An Agile framework for iterative development typically referring to software. It can also refer a daily status meeting

### Sidebar \#UA

### Sprint \#OS

The segment of time a development team works on goals that ends with delivery of a feature or improvement. Sprints begin with planning and end with retrospective

### Stand Up \#OS

A short, daily meeting where each member of the team answers three questions:

* What has been done since the last stand-up?
* What will be done before the next stand-up?
* What impediments stand in your way?

### Self-Hosted Server \#UA

Having your own personal data hosted on your own rather relying on a third-party. People who prefer self-hosting are in favor of being in control and responsible for their own services and data autonomously.

### Task \#OS 

A unit of work that is estimated in hours, typically small enough that they should be able to be completed before the next daily meeting. 

### Transclusions \#?

### Unlinked References \#UA

An overview at the bottom of a page that shows blocks that mention the exact words of the page title, but don't link to it. 

### User \#OS

The primary external audience. A user could also be a buyer or a customer but does not include internal staff. 

### Vertices \#?
