# Daily notes

To access your daily notes from anywhere in your graph, click on the calendar icon in the top panel or type `Ctrl` + `d`. In this mode, Athens displays all your daily notes in a list that loads previous daily notes as you scroll down. As you reach the end of one note, the previous one loads.

Any individual daily note is also accessible via search. Click the **Find or Create a Page** button or type `Ctrl/âŒ˜` + `k`.
