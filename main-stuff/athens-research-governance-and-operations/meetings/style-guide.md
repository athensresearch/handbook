# Style Guide

When contributing to the Athens website, handbook, and other resources, refer to the Athens Style Guide to ensure that your contributions are formatted correctly. 

Athens is a global community-led organization. Our Style Guide currently supports the use of United States English in order to standardize all content. This guide aims to provide a standard of reference including how to render dates and times, when to capitalize, etc.

The Style Guide is followed across all Athens content including but not limited to the website, blog, videos, and resources. Contributors should adhere to this style, but prioritize contributing available material over considering style. 

This guide is a work in progress and additions are welcome. 

Please note, Athens is a singular entity. Therefore, when referring to Athens, verbs should be singular.
