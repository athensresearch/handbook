## Mission

## Values

> Don’t explain your philosophy. Embody it.

— Epictetus

Athens is not just a product. Athens is a community for collaboration and learning.

When participating in the Athens community, you are agreeing to embody Athens's values. But values and communities become real through actions, not words. As Athens matures, we will add epics and hero's journeys that exemplify Athens's values to this page.

### Collaboration

> Associate with people who are likely to improve you.

— Seneca

### Learning

> The object of education is to teach us to love what is beautiful.

— Plato

### Open-Source

### Private

 You can use Athens as a local desktop app that saves data to your filesystem or with a [self-hosted server](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens-backend).

### Extensible

You can modify Athens's source code. We are also building a plugin system for custom themes, keybindings, and integrations with other data sources.

### Community-Driven

 Athens has a Discord with over 2,458 members. We handle support and feature development on Discord and GitHub. Every Sunday at 11am Pacific, we have a community call. You can help shape Athens — [join us](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V)!

## Why Athens

The problem today is that we are getting drowned in information. If we don't take notes, we forget everything. So we take notes, but then we have too many notes! Search doesn't work. Folders don't work. And no one does tagging.

Athens lets you take notes without praying to the search gods, without double-clicking endlessly on folders, and without manual tagging.

Athens does this with **\[\[bidirectional links\]\]** and **\(\(block references\)\)** that let you to take notes on anything from any page. Just \[\[link\]\] or \(\(reference\)\) another page or block - and voilà! - you can now go to this page and see all the places that linked back to it. The next time you press `[[` or `((`, you will be indexing through your previous notes, helping you connect the dots. You've starting creating a graph of your knowledge!

## Why Open-Source

[https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/23/why-open-source/](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/23/why-open-source/)

We believe education is basic human right.

We believe being a human means being a life-long learner.

Every person should have the right to own their knowledge privately.

Open-source is the only option.

Make better decision, build stronger idea webs, balance productivity & creativity, learn-in-public.
