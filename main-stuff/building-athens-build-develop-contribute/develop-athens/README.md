# Contributing to Development



* Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V) ðŸ‘¾ and check out the `#ðŸ¤–-programming` channel. The channel is for anything engineering-related!
  * Post work updates in the `#ðŸ› -build-in-public`. This keeps the team on the same page! Let's avoid stepping on each others toes, minimize blockers / dependencies, and cheer each other on!
  * Ask for someone to review your work or PR in the `#ðŸ”©-review-requests` channel.
* Watch the repo and bookmark our [Project Board](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/projects/2). This is the ultimate source of truth for product roadmapping.
* To start working on your PR, you have a few ways to get started:
  1. ask a question in our `#ðŸ¤–-programming` [Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V) channel
  2. comment on one of the existing top-level issues on the project board
  3. create a PR draft or issue, then assign yourself \(prefer drafts over new issues\)
* In all the cases above, try to scope out what you want to do and how, to the extent that you can at the start of a task! If you aren't sure about the scopes, chat in our Discord. If you feel confident, go ahead and start your PR draft â€” you don't need permission to start!
* Read [Product Development at Athens](https://www.notion.so/athensresearch/Product-Development-at-Athens-4c99e37d1713441c99360668c39e5db7) to see our shipping philosophy. It's more nuanced than just "agile", with some inspiration from Basecamp. ðŸ› 
* If you don't have experience programming with Clojure, checkout our learning resources and join [ClojureFam](https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam) to learn with some friends! In our experience, it takes ~4 weeks of part-time study to begin making solid code contributions to Athens.
