# Using the Handbook

This site is built from the main branch of [this Athens repo](https://github.com/athensresearch/handbook). 

## How to Use this Handbook

This handbook documents operations at Athens Research, including: using Athens, building Athens, managing team operations, and learning in the School of Athens. This is an open, living document created by a handful of volunteers that use and love Athens. The primary goal is to provide all the key resources needed to operate Athens as well as to contribute to grow a diverse Athens community, so that Athens becomes the best possible tool for the most people. 

Athens is a free, open-source resource and we are committed to keeping it that way. We welcome comments and feedback from everyone and hope that people of any expertise or background feel comfortable sharing and helping us build. Diversity matters.
