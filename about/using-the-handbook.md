## How to Use this Handbook

The purpose of this handbook is to increase clarity for all members of the community. This is an open, living document created by a handful of volunteers that use and love Athens built from [this Athens repo](https://github.com/athensresearch/handbook) and as such is a continual work-in-progress.   
  
This handbook documents all operations at Athens Research, including: using Athens, building Athens, managing team [operations](../main-stuff/athens-research-governance-and-operations/), and learning in the [Athens Academy](../main-stuff/learning-at-athens-academy-education/).  The primary goal is to provide all the key resources needed to operate Athens as well as to grow a diverse Athens community, so that Athens becomes the best possible tool for the most people. Athens takes a [handbook-first approach](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first) and is intentional about documentation that creates a [single source of truth](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#single-source-of-truth). We value transparency and make our handbook publicly accessible to all. 

Athens is a free, open-source resource and we are committed to keeping it that way. We welcome comments and feedback from everyone and hope that people of any expertise or background feel comfortable sharing and helping us build. Diversity matters.

## How to Make This Handbook Better

If you use Athens, please consider helping us make the handbook better. Growing companies are works-in-progress. As an open-source company we like to share early and often because we get feedback sooner, can iterate faster, and provide better results.



When you see a way that we can improve, the easiest way is to leave a comment is by touching a paragraph with your mouse pointer and clicking the plus sign that appears next to the paragraph.
