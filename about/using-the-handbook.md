## About This Handbook

This is a living document. Handbook first values. 

This handbook is a living document centralizing all operations. It is maintained by everyone in the community; your contributions are welcome. All contributors must follow our Code of Conduct.

## How to Use this Handbook

The purpose of this handbook is to increase clarity for all members of the community. This is an open, living document created by a handful of volunteers that use and love Athens built from [this Athens repo](https://github.com/athensresearch/handbook) and as such is a continual work-in-progress.   
  
This handbook documents all operations at Athens Research, including: using Athens, building Athens, managing team [operations](../company/athens-research-governance-and-operations/), and learning in the [Athens Academy](../community/get-involved/learning-at-athens-academy-education/).  The primary goal is to provide all the key resources needed to operate Athens as well as to grow a diverse Athens community, so that Athens becomes the best possible tool for the most people. Athens takes a [handbook-first approach](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first) and is intentional about documentation that creates a [single source of truth](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#single-source-of-truth). We value transparency and make our handbook publicly accessible to all. 

Athens is a free, open-source resource and we are committed to keeping it that way. We welcome comments and feedback from everyone and hope that people of any expertise or background feel comfortable sharing and helping us build. Diversity matters.

Questions? Ask anything in our [Discussion](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/discussions) area and for quick help  come chat with the team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/as9h8yHNfD).

## How to Make This Handbook Better

If you use [Athens](https://athens-research.webflow.io/), please consider helping us make the [handbook](https://athensresearch.gitbook.io) better. Growing companies are works-in-progress. As an open-source company we like to share early and often because we get feedback sooner, iterate faster, and provide better results.   
  
While the term documentation typically refers to the process of writing after an even, please note, our handbook has been drafted with the belief that documentation should happen first, e.g. find a solution, document the solution, then announce on Github \(our single source of truth\), which can be shared on Discord. As a team grows, if it's documentation grows with it, efficiency will reign supreme rather than seeing new team members ask and re-ask for the same answers bogging down meetings and disrupting fluid knowledge exchange. On top of that, Athens is a remote-only company that relies on asynchronous culture to unite it's worldwide team. Tools like Discord are meant for limited-retention, informal messaging and quite poor for project management because they easily create knowledge gaps that disrupt team communications due to lacking context and universal accessibility. 

Feedback on this handbook is greatly appreciated. There are three ways that you can share your feedback and suggestions. 

1. When you see a way that we can improve, the quickest way is to leave a comment.  Touch the paragraph with your mouse pointer and click the plus sign that appears to the right of the paragraph. 
2. You can also make suggestions by using the Github platform. Github helps developers manage software projects by allowing many contributors to work together at the same time by participating in discussions, submitting issues like bug reports, making [pull requests](https://github.com/athensresearch/handbook/pulls), and committing changes.
