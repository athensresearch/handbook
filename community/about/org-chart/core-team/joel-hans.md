### Bio

I've taken a pretty strange, circuitous route to the Athens universe. More than 10 years ago I started in trade magazine publishing for manufacturing professionals. After a few years, I set off for Arizona to get my Masters in Fine Arts in creative writing and work as the managing editor of _Fairy Tale Review_, an annual literary journal dedicated to the contemporary fairy tale. I started a tech copywriting consultancy, nabbed some neat clients like IBM, Red Hat, and Johnson & Johnson, then joined Netdata to lead their documentation and educational content.

I love thinking about information architecture, creating community&lt;&gt;product feedback loops, and helping people learn complex topics. I'm looking forward to opportunities to mentor community members and give them new tools to solve tough problems.

I'm also an mountain biker, fiction writer, and father to two young daughters who will absolutely make regular appearances on future community calls.
