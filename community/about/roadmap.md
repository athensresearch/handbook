# Roadmap

Athens Research publishes updates regularly. You can find [our current roadmap here](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/projects/12). Our roadmap is our educated guess of upcoming project completion goals and is based on our current team's experience and the requests that come from the community.   
  
We welcome team and community feedback for our roadmap and aim for further transparency and better inclusion. Community desires and submissions are important to us. 

You can offer feedback on the roadmap by:

* Joining our weekly Community Call
* Posting in the \#community-ideas channel in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/as9h8yHNfD)
* Contributing to or create a new discussion on Github

See Athens Communication Channels for information on how to join and use Discord.
