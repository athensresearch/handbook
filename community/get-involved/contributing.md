# Overview

The final Athens vision is for everyone, one day, to learn how to learn anything.

To do that, it is mission-critical to create a space and culture where we can [work with one another and learn from one another](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We're always looking to bring new people and new ideas into Athens. There's plenty of ways to get involved, from development, design, documentation, and more. Don't hesitate to jump in!
