  We're still working on the details, but we'd love to see design-related

# Improve Design

* Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V) ðŸ‘¾ and see what's happening in the `#ðŸ–‹-design` channel.
* Duplicate the [Athens Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/XITWUHZHNJsIbcCsBkOHpZ/Athens-Design-System?node-id=0%3A1) on Figma to get the building blocks for creating UIs and workflows.
* See previous concepts in the [Product Design Sandbox](https://www.figma.com/file/iCXP6z7H5IAQ6xyFr5AbZ7/Product-Design-Sandbox?node-id=183%3A37). This Figma is no longer actively used, but seeing previous work can help!
