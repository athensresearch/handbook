# File issues and bugs

The Athens community uses [GitHub's issues](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/) feature to identify and track bugs and their associated fixes. We hope you'll help us in this effort to make Athens more stable and usable!

Issues or bugs can be a lot of different things:

* A crash in the Athens application.
* A typo in the Athens interface.
* Unexpected behavior or design that interrupts how you use Athens.

If you're not sure, err on the side of filing an issue.

### File an issue or bug

The first step is to search the [existing bugs](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues) to see if your bug or concern has already been reported by another member of the Athens community. If it's already there, feel free to add additional context to the existing issue or simply give it a thumbs-up reaction to showcase to the community that is a repeatable issue.

If there are no existing issues that match the bug you're experiencing, click [here](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+%F0%9F%90%9E+bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) to start the bug report.

Enter a descriptive title. In the text area below, use the provided template to describe your **problem**, add any **screenshots** or **recordings** of the issue, and note which version of Athens you're using.

{% hint style="info" %}
To see which version of Athens you're running, open the **Navigation Sidebar** by clicking on the hamburger icon in the top-left corner. The version is shown near the bottom of the Athens interface and follows a pattern like `1.0.0-beta-89`.
{% endhint %}

### Tips for good bug reports

* Make sure you've searched Athens repository for existing issues or discussions! 
* Keep in mind that what you think of as a bug might actually be a purposeful design decision.
* Provide information and context in each of the **Problem**, **Screenshots/Demo**, and **Athens Version** headings in the bug report template.
