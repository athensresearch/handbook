# Ask & answer questions

The Athens community is all about learning in public, and in order to learn, we need people who are willing to learn _and_ we need teachers! Asking questions, or giving helpful answers in response, helps grow the community's collective understanding.

Feel free to ask & answer questions on any pillar of the Athens community. 

* **Discord:** Most application-specific questions/answers should go in the `#help` and `#questions` channels on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/as9h8yHNfD).
* **GitHub**: The best place is the [Discussions forum](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/discussions).
* **Twitter**: Find us on Twitter [@AthensResearch](https://twitter.com/AthensResearch).

### Ask

There are a few ways to make your question as valuable to the community as possible:

* Search the [Athens repository on GitHub](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens), including the [Discussions](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/discussions) and [issues](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues), to see if someone asked and answered the question before you.
* If you're on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/as9h8yHNfD), search there as well.
* Describe your issue or concern in as much detail as possible to reduce back-and-forth.
* Thank the person\(s\) who end up answering you!

### Answer

Here are a few things to keep in mind when answering questions:

* Follow our [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct.md) at all times.
* You always have the authority to answer a question! There is no hierarchy to the Athens community and no "owner" of a certain type of question.
* Maintain a positive and empathetic tone when answering questions. All of us are always learning.
* Link to a page in the handbook or a GitHub issue/PR/discussion thread as part of your answer if there is documentation or further context available.
* If you can answer part of a question but think there should be follow-up from someone else who might know more, check out the profiles of the [core team](../../../company/org-chart/core-team/) and loop in the most relevant person.

If you've answered the same question a few times, or see others do the same, it might be time for an [improvement to the handbook](contributing-documentation.md).
