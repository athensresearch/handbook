# Share sample templates or databases

We're always looking to build out a library of templates and databases that any Athens user can download and start applying to their knowledge graph. We don't currently have a centralized "library" of these assets at this point. In fact, we're mostly focused on getting the community to share these workflows so that we can compile them into a centralized location.

### Templates

Templates are placeholder blocks that you paste into a new page to provide some preconfigured structure. For example, if you use Athens for a daily journal, you might start with a template like this:

```text
- **How many hours of sleep did I get?**
  - 
- **How am I feeling this morning?**
  - 
- **What's the one thing I need to get done today to move forward?**
  -
```

Here's how to share a template:

* Paste your template directly into the `#workflow` channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/as9h8yHNfD).
* Create a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and paste your template into it.
  * Share your Gist on the `#workflow` channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/as9h8yHNfD).
  * Tweet us at [@athensresearch](https://mobile.twitter.com/AthensResearch).

### Databases

Sample databases are one way that newer Athens users can explore [workflows](share-your-experiences.md) and learn organizational strategies from those who are more experienced with personal knowledegebase management \(PKM\) tools. 

We have a [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E8z-s33PfzNCGxEsZNQlB5niVq9bKQg0?usp=sharing) that anyone can upload an sample database to. We hope that, in time, we'll have dozens of sample databases to explore and learn from.

Use the following process to upload a sample database:

* Create a copy of your database \(the `index.transit` file\).
* Rename your database from `index.transit` to something else that describes your use case or workflow. For example, `book-club.transit`.
* Upload your database to the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E8z-s33PfzNCGxEsZNQlB5niVq9bKQg0?usp=sharing).
* Let us know about it!
  * Share the link to your database in the `#workflows` channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/as9h8yHNfD).
  * Tweet us at [@athensresearch](https://mobile.twitter.com/AthensResearch).

Don't upload a database with personal information that you don't want shared!
