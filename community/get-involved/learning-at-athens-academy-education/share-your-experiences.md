# Share your workflow

One of the challenges in using knowledge graph tools like Athens is understanding how to get started and how to most effectively organize your thoughts. Even with powerful features like [Bidirectional Links](../../athens-guide/feature-list/bidirectional-links.md) and [Block References](../../athens-guide/feature-list/block-references.md), which effectively eliminate the need to waste time organizing your notes into a hierarchical file-folder structure, we tend to constantly search for the "best" way to use Athens.

We tend to ask questions like:

* Should I take notes in the daily pages, or on per-subject pages?
* Should I make a new block for this thought, or an entirely new page?
* When should I use the `[[link]]` syntax as opposed to `#[[link]]` and how does that affect my workflow?
* _What if I don't get it right the first time?_

You can help eliminate this fear by sharing your workflow. Here's a few suggestions on how to do just that:

* **Write a blog post**: Give us a guided tour of your knowledge graph, along with strategies on how and why you organize your thoughts. Here's some good examples using Athens and similar tools:
  * [Multiplayer Learning in Public with Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Symposium/page/4i6PyCSfi)
  * 
* **Record a video**: Use [Loom](https://loom.com), or any desktop screen recording tool, and a microphone to record yourself walking through how you use Athens to take notes and organize your thought. Again, some good examples:
  * [How we're using @RoamResearch to build collective learning in the @code423n4 DAO](https://www.loom.com/share/7316d46335e1480eb548b4a3c1e2de86)
* **Upload your templates or database:** If you have a "template" that you copy-paste into your daily page, or an [entire database you're willing to share](submit-templates-or-databases.md), we'd love to explore.
