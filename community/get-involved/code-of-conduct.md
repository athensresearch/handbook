## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [researchathens@gmail.com](mailto:researchathens@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

### Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.0, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code\_of\_conduct.html](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html).

Community Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).

## Values

> Don’t explain your philosophy. Embody it.

— Epictetus

Athens is not just a product. Athens is a community for collaboration and learning.

When participating in the Athens community, you are agreeing to embody Athens's values. But values and communities become real through actions, not words. As Athens matures, we will add epics and hero's journeys that exemplify Athens's values to this page.

### Collaboration

> Associate with people who are likely to improve you.

— Seneca

### Learning

> The object of education is to teach us to love what is beautiful.

— Plato

## Athens Discord

### Inviting

Athenians are free to invite others to the Athens Discord, but the Core Team and Guardians reserve the right to revoke this permission.

This would be necessary in case there were growing pains from premature scaling or in the case of bad actors trying to disrupt the Athens Discord with spambots.

This is also why invites expire after 24 hours by default.

### Kicking and Banning

If there are spambots or members severely transgressing the Athens values and guidelines, it is the responsibility of Guardians and Core Team members to kick or ban these bad actors.

If it is unclear why the kick or ban was necessary, a DM will be sent to follow-up on this event and clarify the rationale.

Kicking removes the user from the server. The user can be re-invited and then rejoin.

Banning is a permanent removal from the server. Particularly effective for spambots.

### Auto-Moderation

[Probot](https://github.com/athensresearch/handbook/tree/15074e290a2c7e419b8a07f33fac131127a36f0f/probot.io) is used for auto-moderation.

It warns members in the following cases:

* Emoji spam
* Duplicated text
* Bad words
* Spammed caps \(70% &gt; caps\)
* Mass mention \(@everyone\)

It warns members and deletes messages in the following cases:

* Spam \(5 messages / 5 sec\)

### Pruning

Collaboration implies participation. Members of the Discord who do not message after a certain number of days are "pruned" and will need to be re-invited to rejoin the Discord.

### Contributor Channels

In the "Athens \(Product\)" section, we have set up specific channels for those who have made non-trivial contributions to engineering and/or design. This way, communications between contributors can flow freely, while still allowing aspiring contributors to gain invaluable context about how and why certain decisions are made. More context about this change in our Discord can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/athensresearch/Open-Source-Conversations-Discord-a8c959de3b194cefadd48b497fc12079).

## Discord Official

### Discord Guidelines

You agree to the official Discord [Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) while using Discord. Evidence of the following may result in the termination of your account from the Discord platform:

* harassment
* spam
* pornography of minors
* violation of rights
* promotion of self-harm or suicide
* animal cruelty
* threatening to harm others
* distributing viruses
* shaming or degrading others
* attempting to steal
* doing anything illegal

### Discord Terms of Service

You agree to the official Discord [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) while using Discord.

As Athens is an open-source technology project, one section worth emphasizing is the section on intellectual property.

> As an example, you agree not to use the Service in order to:
>
> violate the contractual, personal, intellectual property or other rights of any party including using, uploading, transmitting, distributing, or otherwise making available any information made available through the Service in any manner that infringes any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other right of any party \(including rights of privacy or publicity\)

If you believe your intellectual property rights have been violated, please email the Athens team immediately at researchathens@gmail.com.

### Discord Privacy Policy

You agree to the official Discord [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy) while using Discord.

Discord collects the following information:

* information you provide, which includes but is not limited to: username, email address, messages, images, transient VOIP data, or other content sent via chat
* IP address, device ID, and your activities within the Services
* information through other Services such as Twitter and Facebook, if connected
* information on cookies



* Either role grants you write-access to all three channels.
  * **\#engineers** – engineers have contributed some amount of engineering to the Athens GitHub repository.
  * **\#designers** – designers have contributed designs to Athens. So far, all contributions have been on Figma.
  * **\#product** – product is about direction: "We have two comparable solutions, what tradeoffs do we want to make?"
* A member of the Core Team will update your role.
  * A line of documentation, a line of code, or a line in Figma doesn't count.
  * But the bar is not absurdly high. One solid PR or mockup could be enough, and has been for some.
  * Indirect contributions are factored into this decision, e.g. productive discussions on GitHub, Discord, Twitter, etc.
  * This should scale for now — everyone sees everyone's contributions in open-source.

## Context

At the start of the Discord, we had **\#🖌-design** and **\#🤖 -engineering** channels.

However, it was incredibly difficult to make progress on things like the design system. It quickly became clear that we needed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio between designers and non-designers, contributors and non-contributors.

So we made private channels, and now Athens has a top-notch design system to build an amazing product and tool!

However, it has become evident that the more private channels we have, the harder it would be for new contributors to get started. They'd be missing out on perhaps the most important context to orient themselves: the conversations between contributors.

Thus, we are "open-sourcing" these conversations now \(**\#engineers \#designers \#product**\). Like our GitHub, anyone can read. But to write, you'll need to submit a Pull Request \(or designs, research, etc.\).

It's possible that these channels should've always been read-only. It was, in fact, brought up and considered. It's also possible that it was the right decision, at the time.

Either way, we do believe making these work channels public is the right move now and for the foreseeable future.

Democracy is a balancing act between empowering everyone and empowering those that have contributed with their power. At Athens, we want to empower everyone by making the "Commons" as accessible as possible. We also want to empower those that have contributed by giving them more \[voice\]\([https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md\#user-content-table-of-contents:~:text=you have two options%3A Voice or Exit.\)](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#user-content-table-of-contents:~:text=you%20have%20two%20options%3A%20Voice%20or%20Exit.%29), particularly with one another.
