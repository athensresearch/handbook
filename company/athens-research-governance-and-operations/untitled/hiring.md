# Hiring

#### \*\*\*\*



#### **TL;DR: DM Jeff Tang on Discord saying you're interested and start contributing!**

## Summary

* Why

  Our mission is to create open-source software to augment intelligence and knowledge management for individuals, teams, and enterprises in the short-term, and global communities in the long-term.

  Our [vision](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/VISION.md) is to create a **second brain** and **second internet** using knowledge graphs and bidirectional links. A second brain would be your central knowledge platform for yourself and your collaborators. A second internet would be a globally-connected system of information and communication flows, like the Internet but rewired with bidirectional links and data. Eventually, these global knowledge graphs will be built on open and decentralized protocols so that users remain empowered to own and extend their data.

* What

  We are building a new platform, the knowledge graph, with a new primitive, the bidirectional link. The first killer use cases for knowledge graphs and bidirectional links are research and notetaking.

  Notetaking naturally moves into task and project management. Task management naturally moves into calendar and time management. Calendar moves into coordination and communications more broadly, e.g. chat, email, and social networks.

  First, we can reimagine standalone applications on top of knowledge graphs — Trello, Twitter, Slack, and so on. Then, we can reimagine how these applications communicate and interoperate with each other. Perhaps Athens is the central hub for all of these information flows.

  The knowledge graph is a new, open platform. Perhaps our browsers or operating systems could be reworked as well with some of these ideas.

* Where / How

  Being in an open-source community that [values collaboration and learning](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), you will need to be friendly and communicative. 99% of our work and communication happens in open channels — "building in public."

  This is more than a Monday through Friday 9-to-5. [Every Sunday we have a community call on Discord](https://www.loom.com/team-videos/Athens/Community%20Calls), because that is when many our contributors and users have free time. This is typically a casual hangout. If it feels like "work," something is wrong!

  Because we have contributors from all over the world, we are distributed and remote-first. Expect to work asynchronously and be mindful of collaborators' timezones. That said, we encourage synchronous voice+video via Discord and async voice+video with Loom to maintain the human connection.

* Who

  We are an early stage startup funded by the best investors in the world like Y Combinator.

  You will be joining as one of the first hires. Being an early startup hire, you will have to be:

  * scrappy, hungry, and resourceful — an underdog
  * hardworking, ambitious, and a very fast learner
  * a long-term optimizer, with a short-term bias toward action and execution

  Ideally, you have experience with the domain we're in: text editors and IDEs, productivity and knowledge tools AKA "tools for thought."

  Do you constantly tinker with tools, trendy/new or esoteric/old? Vim, Emacs, Kitemaker, Miro, Whimsical, Craft, Supernotes, nvALT, Leo Editor, VoodooPad, Workflowy, Dynalist, Obsidian, Dendron, Foam, org-mode, Vimflowy, DevonThink, The Archive, Zettlr, Zim, Zenkit, Nimbus Notes, WorldBrain, [Hypothes.is](http://Hypothes.is), Pocket, Instapaper, Airr, Pinboard, Muse, Gingko, TiddlyWiki, Typora, iA Writer

  Perhaps you're inspired by: OGs like Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, Ted Nelson, Tim Berners-Lee, and Stewart Brand; [Designers like Bret Victor, Andy Matuschak, and Michael Nielsen](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1379271262896152580); Productivity gurus like [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.co/), [Ali Abdal](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOae5nYA7VqaXzerajD0lg), and [Thomas Frank](https://www.youtube.com/user/electrickeye91)

  You will working directly with the founder of Athens, Jeff Tang \([Twitter](https://twitter.com/tangjeff0), [GitHub](https://github.com/tangjeff0), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tangjeff0/)\).

  Jeff has a unique combination of skills that makes him a pleasure to work with. The combination of being a kind and intelligent person with excellent organization and communication skills have allowed him to build up a very smart and welcoming community. By creating and launching Athens in a very short time span, he has shown to be both a great developer as well as being very business savvy. You won't regret working with him!

* When / Hiring and Interview Process

  We are hiring now. You should start contributing today, or at least start engaging with the community.

  We do not have a conventional hiring process. Whether you want to join as a product or community developer, making contributions is the hiring and interview process. This is not a proxy for the job. This is the job.

  The more collaboration done through contributions, the more we understand each other's technical and communication abilities and styles, the more we've ensured that it's a good mutual fit. Furthermore, there should be little to no friction for onboarding, or going from contributor to employee.

  Message @Jeff Tang that you are contributing with the expectation of working at Athens. You will be compensated via Gitcoin Bounties for the contributions you make. We are investing heavily in Bounties. It's possible that you get paid more for Bounties _per hour_ than a normal part-time or full-time job. See [Bounty Experiment 3/07/21 - 3/28/21](https://www.notion.so/Bounty-Experiment-3-07-21-3-28-21-d2839e46b19b4bf9aeb6299845974622) for more background.

* Compensation

  We compensate competitively. Salary and equity is primarily factored by experience level, location, and growth potential: [https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/compensation/\#factoring-the-factors](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/compensation/#factoring-the-factors)

  For U.S. employees and contractors, we use [Gusto](https://gusto.com/). For international employees and contractors, we use [Deel](https://letsdeel.com/). We use [Pulley](https://pulley.com/) to manage equity. These are the leading services to handle payroll and benefits.

## Roles

* Junior Engineer

  If you lack Clojure or coding experience, please begin learning at [https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam](https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam) and then start working on bounties [https://www.notion.so/athensresearch/Bounty-Experiment-3-07-21-3-28-21-d2839e46b19b4bf9aeb6299845974622](https://www.notion.so/athensresearch/Bounty-Experiment-3-07-21-3-28-21-d2839e46b19b4bf9aeb6299845974622). You will get paid for these bounties and we can learn about each other's work styles through this.

  There are a number of contributors who are on the path to becoming junior engineers at Athens, where this is their first time doing Clojure. In some cases, this is their first time coding.

  Hiring Process

  * Clojure experience IS NOT a requirement. If you don't have Clojure experience, begin learning Clojure using the resources in our education repo: [https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam](https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam/)
  * Get paid through our Gitcoin bounties. The lowest priced ones are "good first issues." Submit your contributions for review. Document and communicate your thought process. Integrate feedback. This is the job! [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/11pz9719i2\_u2kFj438mZhrZT\_Uez2ne8cRCthVK1Qo4/edit\#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/11pz9719i2_u2kFj438mZhrZT_Uez2ne8cRCthVK1Qo4/edit#gid=0)
  * Prioritizing full-time to begin with, but will consider part-time based if that's the best way to work with a candidate. However, it seems like doing progressively more bounties seems like the best way to transition from contributor to part-time to full-time. A 3-month work trial can also be considered if it makes sense for the candidate.
