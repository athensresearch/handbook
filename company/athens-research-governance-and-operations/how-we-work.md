    > Associate with people who are likely to improve you.

    — Seneca

    * Don’t explain your philosophy. Embody it.

      — Epictetus

      Athens is not just a product. Athens is a community for collaboration and learning.

      When participating in the Athens community, you are agreeing to embody Athens's values. But values and communities become real through actions, not words. As Athens matures, we will add epics and hero's journeys that exemplify Athens's values to this page.

      \*\*\*\*

  * Learning

    > The object of education is to teach us to love what is beautiful.

    — Plato

  * Open-Source
    * Why Open-Source

      [https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/23/why-open-source/](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/23/why-open-source/)

      We believe education is basic human right.

      We believe being a human means being a life-long learner.

      Every person should have the right to own their knowledge privately.

      Open-source is the only option.

      Make better decision, build stronger idea webs, balance productivity & creativity, learn-in-public.

  * Private
    * You can use Athens as a local desktop app that saves data to your filesystem or with a [self-hosted server](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens-backend).



  * Extensible
    * You can modify Athens's source code. We are also building a plugin system for custom themes, keybindings, and integrations with other data sources.
  * Community-Driven
    * Athens has a Discord with over 2,458 members. We handle support and feature development on Discord and GitHub. Every Sunday at 11am Pacific, we have a community call. You can help shape Athens — [join us](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V)!
