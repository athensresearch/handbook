    * Athens is free to use as a local-only desktop app. We are currently building out a hosted software service that will start at $6/month. [We have a self-hosted/on-premise option for enterprises](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens-backend), comparable to GitLab or Mattermost. If you want to use Athens commercially, please contact us at [researchathens@gmail.com](https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=researchathens@gmail.com).
    * Please see our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/athens) for more details. We will be migrating to Stripe from OpenColllective.
