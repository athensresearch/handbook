# Connect with us

The fastest way to connect is to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/as9h8yHNfD). That's where we learn in public. Ask and answer questions, join weekly community calls, connect with other Athenians, and stay up to date on the latest events.

Know a way we can make Athens better? Visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens). Every part of Athens Research is open source and public knowledge. Participate in [discussions](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/discussions), create [issues for bugs](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+%F0%9F%90%9E+bug&template=bug_report.md&title=), and submit [pull requests](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/pulls) if you're contributing code, design, or documentation.

Read more about the history of Athens on the [blog](https://athens-research.ghost.io/). If you think we're on the right track, and believe in our collective vision, sponsor us on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/athens).
