# Product Questions

### What features are you currently working on adding?

See our [roadmap doc](../../about-us/roadmap.md) for details.

As of **June 18, 2021**, the best place to understand the current Athens roadmap is to view the [June 2021 priorities](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/discussions/1354). In terms of the Athens product, the core team is focused exclusively on delivering [self-hosted real-time collaboration](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/projects/16), which is essential to building the most differentiated product in a crowded landscape of knowledge graph tools.

### How can I export my Athens database?

There is currently no export functionality. The core Athens team is still figuring out the complexity of such an effort. Follow the ongoing disucssion around import/export on [GitHub](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/discussions/874).

It is currently possible to _import_ a `.edn` database from Roam. See the [import](../../community/athens-guide/feature-list/import.md) doc for details.
