# Communications

## Meetings

### Community Call

Every Sunday at 11am Pacific. Can be about engineering, announcements, special guest speakers, or undirected! These are recorded for community-members who cannot make them. Post questions and comments in the \#meeting-chat channel if it's easier.

### Standup

Every weekday morning at 8:30am Pacific.

Contributors welcome to join. Anyone welcome to lurk. Get a feel on the relevant stakeholders and try to batch, e.g.  community-focused people can go together, or backend people share.

Whether you make it or don't, post a text version in the \#standup channel. This could take the form of **Did, Doing, Blockers** or **Yesterday, Today, Blockers**. No need to read verbatim what you did during the call, but do share blockers and call out specific people if you are collaborating with them.
