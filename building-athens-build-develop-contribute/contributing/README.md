# Ways to Contribute

## Contributing to Athens

### Developers

* Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V) üëæ and check out the `#ü§ñ-programming` channel. The channel is for anything engineering-related!
  * Post work updates in the `#üõ†-build-in-public`. This keeps the team on the same page! Let's avoid stepping on each others toes, minimize blockers / dependencies, and cheer each other on!
  * Ask for someone to review your work or PR in the `#üî©-review-requests` channel.
* Watch the repo and bookmark our [Project Board](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/projects/2). This is the ultimate source of truth for product roadmapping.
* To start working on your PR, you have a few ways to get started:
  1. ask a question in our `#ü§ñ-programming` [Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V) channel
  2. comment on one of the existing top-level issues on the project board
  3. create a PR draft or issue, then assign yourself \(prefer drafts over new issues\)
* In all the cases above, try to scope out what you want to do and how, to the extent that you can at the start of a task! If you aren't sure about the scopes, chat in our Discord. If you feel confident, go ahead and start your PR draft ‚Äî you don't need permission to start!
* Read [Product Development at Athens](https://www.notion.so/athensresearch/Product-Development-at-Athens-4c99e37d1713441c99360668c39e5db7) to see our shipping philosophy. It's more nuanced than just "agile", with some inspiration from Basecamp. üõ†
* If you don't have experience programming with Clojure, checkout our learning resources and join [ClojureFam](https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam) to learn with some friends! In our experience, it takes ~4 weeks of part-time study to begin making solid code contributions to Athens.

### Designers

* Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V) üëæ and see what's happening in the `#üñã-design` channel.
* Duplicate the [Athens Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/XITWUHZHNJsIbcCsBkOHpZ/Athens-Design-System?node-id=0%3A1) on Figma to get the building blocks for creating UIs and workflows.
* See previous concepts in the [Product Design Sandbox](https://www.figma.com/file/iCXP6z7H5IAQ6xyFr5AbZ7/Product-Design-Sandbox?node-id=183%3A37). This Figma is no longer actively used, but seeing previous work can help!

### Others

* Have other superpowers?! Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V) üëæ, introduce yourself in `#üê£-introductions`, and ask around in `#‚õ≤Ô∏è-general`!

See some real examples in our [commit history](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/commits/master).

### Issues

Please create issues using [our templates](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/new/choose). However, you will almost certainly get feedback and help faster in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V)!

### Pull Requests

If your PR is related to other issue\(s\), reference it by issue number. You can close issues smoothly with [GitHub keywords](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords):

```text
close #1
fix #2
resolve #2
```

This repo only allows those with merge permissions to "Squash and Merge" PRs. This makes reverts easier if they are needed.
