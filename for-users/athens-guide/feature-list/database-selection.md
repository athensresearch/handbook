# Database Selection

With Athens, each graph is its own database and because they are local, you can have as many databases as you want. In Athens, your database is stored on a file called “index.transit”. You can create, open and move databases from right within Athens. To access the database options, click the following icon on the toolbar.

After clicking it, a popover will come up with three panes.
