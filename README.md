## Introduction

Athens Research is an open-source learning community collaborating to build the most powerful and transparent knowledge base. The result is Athens: a free knowledge graph for research and notetaking. 

## How to Use the Handbook

This handbook documents operations at Athens Research, including: using Athens, building Athens, managing team operations, and learning in the School of Athens. This is an open, living document created by a handful of volunteers that use and love Athens. The goal is to provide a key resource to grow the Athens community.

Athens is a free, open-source resource and we are committed to keeping it that way. We welcome comments and feedback from everyone and hope that people of any expertise or background feel comfortable sharing. Diversity makes it better!
