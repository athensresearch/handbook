### Why a handbook? 

This handbook documents all operations at Athens Research, including: using the Athens app, building Athens, managing team [operations](), and learning in the [Athens Academy](). The primary goal is to provide all the key resources needed to operate Athens as well as to grow a diverse Athens community, so that Athens becomes the best possible tool for the most people. Athens takes a [handbook-first approach](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first) and is intentional about documentation that creates a [single source of truth](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#single-source-of-truth). We value transparency and make our handbook publicly accessible to all.

Athens is a free, open-source resource and we are committed to keeping it that way. We welcome comments and feedback from everyone and hope that people of any expertise or background feel comfortable sharing and helping us build. Diversity matters.

### How to make this handbook better

If you use [Athens](https://athens-research.webflow.io/), please consider helping us make the [handbook](https://athensresearch.gitbook.io) better. Growing companies are works-in-progress. As an open-source company we like to share early and often because we get feedback sooner, iterate faster, and provide better results.

While the term documentation typically refers to the process of writing after an event, please note, our handbook has been drafted with the belief that documentation should happen first, e.g. find a solution, document the solution, then announce on GitHub \(our single source of truth\), which can be shared on Discord. As a team grows, if it's documentation grows with it, efficiency will reign supreme rather than seeing new team members ask and re-ask for the same answers bogging down meetings and disrupting fluid knowledge exchange. On top of that, Athens is a remote-only company that relies on asynchronous culture to unite it's worldwide team. Tools like Discord are meant for limited-retention, informal messaging and quite poor for project management because they easily create knowledge gaps that disrupt team communications due to lacking context and universal accessibility.
