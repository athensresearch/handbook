## Introduction

Athens Research is an remote learning community collaborating to build the most powerful and transparent, open-source knowledge base. The result is Athens: a free knowledge graph for research and notetaking. 

## How to Use the Handbook

This handbook documents operations at Athens Research, including: using Athens, building Athens, managing team operations, and learning in the School of Athens. This is an open, living document created by a handful of volunteers that use and love Athens. The primary goal is to provide all the key resources needed to operate Athens as well as to contribute to grow a diverse Athens community, so that Athens becomes the best possible tool for the most people. 

Athens is a free, open-source resource and we are committed to keeping it that way. We welcome comments and feedback from everyone and hope that people of any expertise or background feel comfortable sharing and helping us build. Diversity matters.  
  
If you use Athens, please consider helping us make the handbook better. When you see a way that we can improve, the easiest way is to leave a comment is by touching a paragraph with your mouse pointer and clicking the plus sign that appears next to the paragraph. You can also make suggestions with a [pull request](https://github.com/athensresearch/handbook/pulls). The content is maintained in our [Github repository](https://github.com/athensresearch/handbook).
