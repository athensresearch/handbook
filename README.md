# Athens Research Handbook

[Athens Research](https://athens-research.webflow.io/) is an open-source community that develops software to augment research and knowledge management for individuals, teams, and enterprises. It allows you to capture thoughts mid-flow and connect them with bi-directional links to create a visual network of ideas called a knowledge graph. Your graph is owned by you and \(coming soon\) can be extended to collaborators. We believe this powerful tool has the ability to transform the way we research and solve problems, making it a revolutionary tool for learning and problem solving. Because of its capabilities, we are resolute to offer it [free to individuals](https://athens-research.webflow.io/#download) and built to ensure data remains private. 

Our [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/as9h8yHNfD) is the space we collaborate and learn in public. It is mission-critical to foster a diverse culture focused on learning from one another. As an open-source project, we share our code: as an open-source community, we provide resources to learn how to code, share how we make decisions, and co-work in public. As an all-remote project, we have conversations openly and Discord makes it easy for new people to jump in with ideas. Join us for our next Community Call.

This handbook is a living document centralizing all operations. It is maintained by everyone in the community; your contributions are welcome. All contributors must be prepared to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://athensresearch.gitbook.io/handbook/welcome/code-of-conduct).
