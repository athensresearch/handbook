## Introduction

Athens Research is an open-source learning community collaborating to build the most powerful and transparent open-source, knowledge base. The result is Athens: a free knowledge graph for research and notetaking. 

## How to Use the Handbook

This handbook documents operations at Athens Research, including: how to use Athens, how we build Athens together, how the Athens team operates, and how we help each other learn in the School of Athens. This is an open, living document created by a handful of volunteers that use and love Athens. The goal is to provide a key resource to grow the Athens community.

Our community is active on [discord](https://discord.gg/as9h8yHNfD) and [github](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/discussions).

Athens is a free, open-source resource and we are committed to keeping it that way. We welcome comments and feedback from everyone and hope that people of any expertise or background feel comfortable sharing. Diversity makes it better!   
  
If you use Athens, please consider helping us make the handbook better. The easiest way is to leave a comment by touching a paragraph with your mouse pointer and clicking the plus sign that appears next to the paragraph when you see a way that we can improve. You can also make suggestions with a [pull request](https://github.com/athensresearch/handbook/pulls). The content is maintained in our [Github repository](https://github.com/athensresearch/handbook).
