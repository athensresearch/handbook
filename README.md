# Athens Research Handbook

[Athens Research](https://athens-research.webflow.io/) is an open-source community that develops software for research and notetaking. It allows you to capture thoughts mid-flow and connect them with links to create a visual network of ideas. We believe this powerful tool has the ability to transform the way we research and solve problems, making it revolutionary for learning. Because of its capabilities, we are resolute to offer it [free to individuals](https://athens-research.webflow.io/#download) and ensure their data remains private. 

Our [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/as9h8yHNfD) is the space we collaborate and learn in public. It is mission-critical to foster a diverse culture focused on learning from one another. As an open-source project, we share our code: as an open-source community, we provide resources to learn how to code, share how we make decisions, and co-work in public. As an all-remote project, Discord allows us to have all our conversations openly and makes it easy for people to jump in with ideas. Join us for our next Community Call.

 This handbook is a living document centralizing all operations. It is maintained by everyone in the community; your contributions are welcome.
